## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ Microsoft (_August 2020 - August 2023_)**
- Implemented [Multi-User Authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault) for vaults storing Azure resource backups, safeguarding against Ransomware attacks and insider actions. Currently safeguarding 2000+ vaults across 400+ subscriptions.
- Enhanced Azure Backup by integrating [Built-in Azure Monitor alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor?tabs=recovery-services-vaults), notifying users of critical backup security scenarios and job failures. Operational for 1500+ backup vaults and expanding.
- Streamlined IaaS Virtual Machine backup configuration with Azure Recovery Services Vault, rectifying sync issues, resulting in an 82% decrease in failure rate.
- Automated Azure Workload container authentication certificate rollover and cleanup, saving Azure Backup Ops team 3 days of manual effort monthly for rotating 100+ certificates.

**Product Developer Intern @ IIITB Innovation Centre (_January 2020 - June 2020_)**
- Developed Raydius : A Map-based digital platform to discover and share thehappenings of a neighborhood.
- Conducted Market Research and customer discovery process through 75 interviews and constructed a business model for Raydius.
- Produced an MVP of the final product idea, a Cross-Platform Mobile Application(Android and IOS) using React Native and NoSQL database.

**Software Developer Intern @ Hyperreality Technologies (_August 2019 - November 2019_)**
- Developed Interactive Virtual Reality simulations like assembly/usage of a fireextinguisher and Real world scale visualization of Real Estate.
- Used C#, Unreal Engine and to build and test the VR simulations.
- Organized meetings with multiple stakeholders and demonstrated the developed simulations to clients.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
