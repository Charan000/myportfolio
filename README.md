## About Me
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm your friendly neighborhood code conjurer, worked for 3 years as a software engineer at Microsoft. Iâ€™ve been on a mission to write code and solve real-world solutions that sparkle with innovation. ðŸŒŸ I will be pursuing my masters at UW Seattle to gain new skills in Data Science, because who doesn't like a data-driven adventure? ðŸ“Š Combining data science with my engineering experience, I wish to develop smart technologies, and explore new fields like quant development and product management. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ </p>

## Education
- Master of Science, Information Management - Data Science | **University of Washington Seattle** (_September 2023 - Present_)								       		
- Integrated Master of Technology, Computer Science	| **International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore** (_August 2015 - June 2020_)	

## Work Experience
### Software Engineer @ Microsoft (_August 2020 - August 2023_)
- Designed and developed [Multi-User Authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault) feature for Azure cloud backup vaults to protect 8 critical scenarios, safeguarding over 2000 vaults across nearly 400 subscriptions against ransomware attacks and accidental insider actions.
- Implemented Preflight validation for Azure Backup deployment templates of 4 resources, reducing the failure rate of their deployment due to incorrect input by 85%.
- Optimized the [Configure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/quick-backup-vm-portal#enable-backup-on-a-vm) operation for IaaS VMs with Azure Recovery Services Vault by identifying and resolving inter-service sync issues, resulting in 82% reduction in failure rate.
- Enhanced the efficiency of rollover process for authentication certificates of Azure Workload containers and automated the cleanup for dangling certificates, eliminating 3 days of effort of the Ops team to manually rotate over 100 certificates every month.

### Product Developer Intern @ IIITB Innovation Centre (_January 2020 - June 2020_)
- Conducted market research and customer discovery process through 75 interviews and constructed a business model for  Raydius - a map based digital platform to discover and share the happenings of a neighborhood.
- Produced an MVP for Raydius, a cross-platform mobile application (Android and IOS) using React Native and NoSQL database.
- Validated the customer usage for selected localities in Bangalore and identified 4 types of events as primary verticals, which contributed to enhance the application features for those verticals by later teams.

## Projects
### Telecommunication Spectrum Data Visualization
[Github](https://github.com/Charan000/Telecom-Spectrum-Visualization)

- Visualized the dense Telecom Spectrum data using techniques like Heatmap, Treemap, and Geographical Map Visualization, and added them to the website.
- Used D3.js and javascript for the visualization.
- Levaraged DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Docker, ELK and AWS during the development of the portal. Later hosted the [End Result](https://indiatelecom.netlify.app/) using Netlify.
