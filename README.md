## Work Experience
### Software Engineer @ Microsoft (_August 2020 - August 2023_)
- Implemented [Multi-User Authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault) for vaults storing Azure resource backups, safeguarding against Ransomware attacks and insider actions. Currently safeguarding 2000+ vaults across 400+ subscriptions.
- Enhanced Azure Backup by integrating [Built-in Azure Monitor alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor?tabs=recovery-services-vaults), notifying users of critical backup security scenarios and job failures. Operational for 1500+ backup vaults and expanding.
- Streamlined IaaS Virtual Machine backup configuration with Azure Recovery Services Vault, rectifying sync issues between microservices, resulting in an 82% decrease in failure rate.
- Automated Azure Workload container authentication certificate rollover and cleanup, saving Azure Backup Ops team's manual effort of 3 days every month for rotating 100+ certificates.

### Product Developer Intern @ IIITB Innovation Centre (_January 2020 - June 2020_)
- Developed Raydius : A Map-based digital platform to discover and share the happenings of a neighborhood.
- Conducted Market Research and customer discovery process through 75 interviews and constructed a business model for Raydius.
- Produced an MVP of the final product idea, a Cross-Platform Mobile Application(Android and IOS) using React Native and NoSQL database.

### Software Developer Intern @ Hyperreality Technologies (_August 2019 - November 2019_)
- Developed Interactive Virtual Reality simulations like assembly/usage of a fire extinguisher and Real world scale visualization of Real Estate.
- Used C#, Unreal Engine and to build and test the VR simulations.
- Organized meetings with multiple stakeholders and demonstrated the developed simulations to clients.

## Projects
### Telecommunication Spectrum Data Visualization
[Github](https://github.com/Charan000/Telecom-Spectrum-Visualization)

- Visualized the dense Telecom Spectrum data using techniques like Heatmap, Treemap, and Geographical Map Visualization, and added them to the website.
- Used D3.js and javascript for the visualization.
- Levaraged DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Docker, ELK and AWS during the development of the portal. Later hosted the [End Result](https://indiatelecom.netlify.app/) using Netlify.
