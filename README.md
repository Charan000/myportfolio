## About Me
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm your friendly neighborhood code conjurer, who is passionate about software engineering and data science with more than 3.5 years of work experience. I am currently working as an SDE II at AWS, and I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at Smartsheet and Microsoft. I graduated from the University of Washington with a masters specializing in data science, and before that, I completed my integrated masters degree in computer science at IIIT Bangalore.  Iâ€™ve been on a mission to write code and build real-world solutions that sparkle with innovation. ðŸŒŸ Combining  my engineering experience and knowledge in data science, I wish to develop smart technologies, and explore new fields like data-driven software engineering, while gaining expertise in backend engineering and databases. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ </p>

- **REST API Development:** Developed the create cell links API in GCS to migrate the operation from monolith to microservices, designing the feature to communicate and work across 3 microservices.
- **Infrastructure Cost:** Migrated the VPC network egress of GCS from local NAT gateways to a centralized AWS transit gateway, reducing security vulnerabilities and the infra cost by $6k per month.
- **Code Quality:** Improved GCS code coverage from 68% to 82.4%, and reduced 64 code smells across the code base.

### Software Engineer @ Microsoft (_August 2020 - August 2023_)
- **Product Overview:** Worked on Azure Backup, a highly scalable microservice-based cloud service providing data protection for VMs, developing features and workflows using .NET, C#, Azure, CosmosDB, Javascript, and Swagger.
- **Feature Ownership:**  Led the design, development, integration testing, and launch of [Multi-User Authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault)  for backup vaults using RBAC to protect 8 data loss scenarios, safeguarding over 5000 vaults in 1200 subscriptions.
- **Failure Reduction:** Achieved 92% failure rate reduction by implementing Preflight validation feature using REST APIs and JSON validation for deployment templates of 4 resources, eliminating incorrect input scenarios.
- **Performance Tuning:** Optimized the [Configure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/quick-backup-vm-portal#enable-backup-on-a-vm) operation for IaaS virtual machines by identifying and resolving multi-threading issues and inter-service synchronization issues, which reduced failure rate by 82%.
- **Optimization and Automation:** Enhanced the rollover process of container auth certificates and automated dangling certificates cleanup, saving 3 days of effort of the Ops team to rotate over 100 certificates every month.
- **Monitoring:** Integrated Azure Monitor alerts for backup vaults, enabling real-time monitoring of 10 critical scenarios.
- **Code Coverage:** Improved code coverage of backup management plane service from 65% to 85% in 2 months.
- **On-Call Responsibility:** Resolved 72 production Sev2s and fixed associated bugs in the team-owned areas.
- **Mentorship:** Mentored 2 interns, providing guidance for onboarding, development, code reviews, and testing.
