## Education
- Master of Science, Information Management - Data Science | **University of Washington Seattle** (_September 2023 - Present_)								       		
- Integrated Master of Technology, Computer Science	| **International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore** (_August 2015 - June 2020_)	

## Work Experience
### Software Engineer @ Microsoft (_August 2020 - August 2023_)
- **Backend:** Worked on Azure Backup, a scalable tier-0 service protecting VM data, developing features and workflows across microservices using .NET, C#, and Cosmos DB in an Agile environment.
- **Feature Design:** Designed and developed [Multi-User Authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault) through REST APIs to protect 8 critical data loss scenarios identified through telemetry, safeguarding over 2500 vaults in nearly 500 subscriptions.
- **Failure Reduction:** Implemented Preflight validation for deployment templates of 4 Azure Backup resources, and reduced failure rate of their deployment due to incorrect input by 92%, while maintaining reliability.
- **Performance Tuning:** Optimized the [Configure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/quick-backup-vm-portal#enable-backup-on-a-vm) operation for IaaS virtual machines by identifying and resolving multi-threading issues and inter-service sync issues, which reduced failure rate by 82%.
- **Optimization and Automation:** Enhanced the rollover process of container auth certificates and automated dangling certificates cleanup, saving 3 days of effort of the Ops team to rotate over 100 certificates every month.
- **Monitoring:** Integrated Azure Monitor alerts backup vaults, enabling real-time monitoring of 10 critical scenarios.
- **Code Coverage:** Improved code coverage of backup management plane service from 65% to 85% in 2 months.
- **Mentorship:** Mentored 2 interns, providing guidance for onboarding, development, code reviews, and testing.

### Product Developer Intern @ IIITB Innovation Centre (_January 2020 - June 2020_)
- **Requirements Gathering:** Conducted 75 customer interviews for market research and customer discovery, and constructed a business model for Raydius - a map based platform to discover and manage local events. 
- **Prototyping:** Prototyped an MVP -  a mobile app using Java, React Native and GCP NoSQL database.
- **A/B Testing:** Identified and refined 4 use cases as primary verticals, and increased user engagement by 72%.

### Telecommunication Spectrum Data Visualization
[Github](https://github.com/Charan000/Telecom-Spectrum-Visualization)

- Visualized the dense Telecom Spectrum data using techniques like Heatmap, Treemap, and Geographical Map Visualization, and added them to the website.
- Used D3.js and javascript for the visualization.
- Levaraged DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Docker, ELK and AWS during the development of the portal. Later hosted the [End Result](https://indiatelecom.netlify.app/) using Netlify.
